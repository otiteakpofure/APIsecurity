this is common a design problem 



this is happens whem a a api stores too many information and when interacted with relaseas information that the user should normally not have access tp 
for example , a user who interacts with an API and then maybe the user forgets his password and the user want to talk with the api to restore his password 



HOW DOES THIS WORK 
The attacker just gueesses 



defense 
only accept the properties you want to accept 
all data
