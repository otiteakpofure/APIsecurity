BOLA ( broken object level authorization)
BOLA states that a user being having access to data that he or she should clearly not have access to 
this is problem because they are some data in which a user can have access to and data which users should not have access to 



                              OBJECT LEVEL ATTACJS 
API  ENDPOINTS usually have IDs to represent a particular user or OBJECT
and ID in a url path is also common in a rest based api  OR ID 
DATA IN A COOKIE IN BASE 64 

NOTE: as far the requeest habe an ID that the attacker can change it can lead to a vulnerability 



                                                 BOLA ATTACKS 
AAS FAR THERE IS AN ID OR PATH TO AND ID , YOU CAN RUN THE bola 

1. you can perform the BOLA atttacks on burpusite can interrcepting the rquest and sending request using the numbers in the request to simulate attacks 

  

                                          BOLA DEFENSE 
1. USING ACCESS CONTROL IS access control/ AUTHORIZATION CHECKS , which means an API must authorize peolle 
2. OAuth for secure API authorization and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure data transmission.
